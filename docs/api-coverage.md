# API Coverage

Complete list of all 63 planned tools, their SuperThread API endpoints, and implementation status.

## Development Approach

We're implementing tools **incrementally** to establish solid patterns before scaling:

1. **Phase 1 (Complete)**: Core patterns established ‚úÖ
2. **Phase 2 (Current)**: 32 tools implemented - covering primary workflows ‚úÖ
3. **Phase 3**: Add remaining tools based on usage needs

## Tool Organization

Tools are organized into 9 categories matching SuperThread's domain model.

### Planned ‚è∏Ô∏è

None - all endpoints implemented!

### Notes

- **Archive functionality** is handled by `project_update` with `archived: true/false` parameter (no separate tool needed)
- **Project-card relationships** use dedicated epic endpoints (not the card relationship endpoints)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **UNDOCUMENTED ENDPOINTS**: `project_add_related` and `project_remove_related` were discovered via browser network inspection and are NOT in SuperThread's official API documentation. These may change without notice.
- See `docs/project-card-relationship.md` for details on why projects have separate relationship endpoints

- Deleting a parent comment also removes all child replies

## Search (1 tool)

### Implemented ‚úÖ

| Tool         | Method | Endpoint            | Description                             |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `search_get` | GET    | `/{team_id}/search` | Search across boards, cards, pages, etc |

### Notes

- Search supports filtering by: `types`, `statuses`, `project_id`, `archived`, `field` (title/content)
- Results can be returned grouped by entity type or ungrouped
- Supports pagination via `cursor` parameter

## Remaining Categories

The following categories (11 tools) are planned but not yet implemented:

- **Pages** (7 tools) - Documentation page management
- **Notes** (4 tools) - Meeting note management

These will be added incrementally as we refine implementation patterns.

## Known API Limitations

### Card Content Updates
**Issue:** The `content` field cannot be updated via REST API endpoints.

**Reason:** SuperThread uses [TipTap collaborative editor](https://newsletter.superthread.com/p/how-we-implemented-tiptap-editor) (built on ProseMirror) for all rich text content. Content changes are synced through a real-time collaboration protocol using operational transforms, not traditional REST API endpoints. Each card has a collaboration token (JWT) for connecting to the TipTap collaboration server.

**Technical Details:**
- Content is edited via TipTap's collaborative editing protocol (WebSocket-based)
- Changes are sent as operational transforms (small incremental operations)
- The collaboration token in card responses is used for real-time sync
- Activity polling (`GET /{team_id}/activity?card_id={card_id}`) tracks changes after they're synced

**Workaround:** Content can only be set during card creation via `card_create`. To update existing content, you must use the SuperThread UI. Programmatic content updates would require implementing the TipTap collaboration protocol, which is beyond the scope of a REST API client.

**Status:** This is an architectural limitation, not a missing API endpoint. Network inspection confirmed no REST endpoint exists for content updates.

### Card Member Assignment ‚úÖ SOLVED VIA NETWORK INSPECTION
**Solution Found:** Members can be added/removed from existing cards using undocumented endpoints discovered via browser network inspection:
- **Add member**: `POST /{team_id}/cards/{card_id}/members` with body `{"user_id": "...", "role": "member"}`
- **Remove member**: `DELETE /{team_id}/cards/{card_id}/members/{user_id}`

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è These endpoints are UNDOCUMENTED in SuperThread's official API and were discovered by inspecting browser network traffic. They may change without notice.

**Tools:** ‚úÖ `card_add_member` and `card_remove_member` have been implemented

### Empty DELETE Responses
**Note:** DELETE endpoints (e.g., `card_delete`) return empty responses with no JSON body. Our API client handles this by returning `{success: true}` for empty 200/204 responses.
