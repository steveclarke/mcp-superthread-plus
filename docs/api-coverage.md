# API Coverage

Complete list of all 60 planned tools, their SuperThread API endpoints, and implementation status.

## Development Approach

We're implementing tools **incrementally** to establish solid patterns before scaling:

1. **Phase 1 (Current)**: 3 tools implemented - establishing patterns
2. **Phase 2**: Add 5-10 more commonly used tools
3. **Phase 3+**: Continue adding based on actual usage needs

## Tool Organization

Tools are organized into 9 categories matching SuperThread's domain model.

## Remaining Categories

The following categories (22 tools) are planned but not yet implemented:

- **Pages** (7 tools) - Documentation page management
- **Notes** (4 tools) - Meeting note management
- **Comments** (8 tools) - Comment and reply management
- **Search** (1 tool) - Global search across entities

These will be added incrementally as we refine implementation patterns.

## Known API Limitations

### Card Content Updates
**Issue:** The `content` field cannot be updated via the PATCH `/{team_id}/cards/{card_id}` endpoint.

**Reason:** Card content editing likely requires the WebSocket-based real-time collaboration API for concurrent editing support.

**Workaround:** Content can only be set during card creation via `card_create`. To update content, you must use the SuperThread UI or implement WebSocket collaboration protocol.

**Reference:** Official API documentation does not list `content` as an updatable field for the PATCH endpoint.

### Card Member Assignment
**Issue:** Members cannot be assigned to existing cards via the PATCH `/{team_id}/cards/{card_id}` endpoint.

**Reason:** Member assignment after card creation likely requires a separate dedicated endpoint (not yet discovered in API documentation).

**Workaround:** Members can only be assigned during card creation via `card_create` using the `members` parameter. To add members to existing cards, use the SuperThread UI.

**Status:** We have not yet found a working API endpoint for adding members to existing cards.

### Empty DELETE Responses
**Note:** DELETE endpoints (e.g., `card_delete`) return empty responses with no JSON body. Our API client handles this by returning `{success: true}` for empty 200/204 responses.
