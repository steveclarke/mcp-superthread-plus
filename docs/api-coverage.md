# API Coverage

Complete list of all 57 planned tools, their SuperThread API endpoints, and implementation status.

## Development Approach

We're implementing tools **incrementally** to establish solid patterns before scaling:

1. **Phase 1 (Complete)**: Core patterns established ‚úÖ
2. **Phase 2 (Current)**: 32 tools implemented - covering primary workflows ‚úÖ
3. **Phase 3**: Add remaining tools based on usage needs

## Tool Organization

Tools are organized into 9 categories matching SuperThread's domain model.

### Notes

- Comments support status values: `resolved`, `open`, `orphaned`
- Reply operations use child comment endpoints under the parent comment path
- Deleting a parent comment also removes all child replies

## Search (1 tool)

### Implemented ‚úÖ

| Tool         | Method | Endpoint            | Description                          |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `search_get` | GET    | `/{team_id}/search` | Search across boards, cards, pages, etc |

### Notes

- Search supports filtering by: `types`, `statuses`, `project_id`, `archived`, `field` (title/content)
- Results can be returned grouped by entity type or ungrouped
- Supports pagination via `cursor` parameter

## Remaining Categories

The following categories (11 tools) are planned but not yet implemented:

- **Pages** (7 tools) - Documentation page management
- **Notes** (4 tools) - Meeting note management

These will be added incrementally as we refine implementation patterns.

## Known API Limitations

### Card Content Updates
**Issue:** The `content` field cannot be updated via the PATCH `/{team_id}/cards/{card_id}` endpoint.

**Reason:** Card content editing likely requires the WebSocket-based real-time collaboration API for concurrent editing support.

**Workaround:** Content can only be set during card creation via `card_create`. To update content, you must use the SuperThread UI or implement WebSocket collaboration protocol.

**Reference:** Official API documentation does not list `content` as an updatable field for the PATCH endpoint.

### Card Member Assignment
**Issue:** Members cannot be assigned to existing cards via the PATCH `/{team_id}/cards/{card_id}` endpoint.

**Reason:** Member assignment after card creation likely requires a separate dedicated endpoint (not yet discovered in API documentation).

**Workaround:** Members can only be assigned during card creation via `card_create` using the `members` parameter. To add members to existing cards, use the SuperThread UI.

**Status:** We have not yet found a working API endpoint for adding members to existing cards.

### Empty DELETE Responses
**Note:** DELETE endpoints (e.g., `card_delete`) return empty responses with no JSON body. Our API client handles this by returning `{success: true}` for empty 200/204 responses.
