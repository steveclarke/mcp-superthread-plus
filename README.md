### Running Locally

Configure your MCP client to run from your local development directory:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "superthread": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/mcp-superthread-plus/dist/index.js"],

### Architecture

This server uses a composition-based API client architecture with resource classes for each domain (cards, boards, projects, etc.). The client handles authentication, error handling, and automatic terminology mapping between Superthread's modern UI terms and legacy API terms.

**For contributors:** See [`docs/contributing/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/contributing/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed architectural information and [`docs/contributing/API-REFERENCE.md`](docs/contributing/API-REFERENCE.md) for API terminology mapping.

**Important notes:** See [`docs/NOTES.md`](docs/NOTES.md) for information about API quirks, limitations, and undocumented endpoints.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome! We're building this incrementally with a focus on quality.

**Areas for contribution:**
- Additional tools for remaining endpoints
- Enhanced response filtering and formatting
- Performance optimizations
- Documentation improvements

See [`docs/contributing/`](docs/contributing/) for architectural details and implementation patterns.
