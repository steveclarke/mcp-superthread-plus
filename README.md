## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Pre-Release Software

**This is very much a work in progress.** Please read this carefully before using:

- **Interim Solution:** Superthread has an [official MCP server](https://api.superthread.com/mcp) which they're actively developing. Our goal is to provide a more complete toolset with full read/write API access until their official server expands. We are **not** trying to replace their official server‚Äîwe're confident they're building it out‚Äîwe just wanted more comprehensive functionality now. This is something to use in the meantime.

- **Not Production-Ready:** This server is not yet at version 1.0 and should be used with caution. It may never reach version 1.0 as Superthread continues to expand their official MCP server.

- **Unofficial & Independent:** This is a community project and is not officially affiliated with or endorsed by Superthread.

- **Direct API Passthrough:** This server makes direct API calls to the Superthread API and returns all data exactly as received. We do not perform any caching, data reduction, or transformation. This means responses can be large and may impact performance.

- **Use at Your Own Risk:** While we've taken reasonable security precautions, this is experimental software. Test thoroughly in non-critical environments before relying on it for important workflows.

- **Limited Support:** This is a community project maintained in spare time. Issues and pull requests are welcome.

**Bottom line:** If you need something stable and production-ready, wait for Superthread's official solution. If you need functionality now and understand the risks, this server aims to help bridge the gap.

## Installation

Add to your MCP settings file (e.g., Claude Desktop config):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "superthread": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-superthread-plus"],
      "env": {
        "SUPERTHREAD_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Requirements:** Node.js 22+

### Getting Your API Key

1. Log into Superthread ‚Üí Settings & Preferences ‚Üí Account ‚Üí API Access
2. Create token
3. Add to your MCP config above

## Configuration

All configuration is done via environment variables:

| Variable                       | Required | Default                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | -------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `SUPERTHREAD_API_KEY`          | ‚úÖ Yes    | -                                | Personal Access Token from Superthread account                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `SUPERTHREAD_API_BASE_URL`     | No       | `https://api.superthread.com/v1` | API endpoint (only change for testing)                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `SUPERTHREAD_ENABLED_TOOLS`    | No       | (all enabled)                    | Comma-separated list of tool domains to enable. **If not set or empty, ALL tools are enabled.** Available domains: `users`, `cards`, `boards`, `projects`, `spaces`, `sprints`, `pages`, `comments`, `notes`, `tags`, `search` |
| `SUPERTHREAD_LISTS_ADD_TO_TOP` | No       | (none)                           | Comma-separated list of list name patterns for smart positioning. Cards moved/created in matching lists are positioned at top (position 0). Supports wildcards (`*`). Example: `"Done,Complet*,*finished,*archive*"`           |

### Selective Tool Enabling

By default, **all tool domains are enabled** when `SUPERTHREAD_ENABLED_TOOLS` is not set. This ensures backward compatibility and full functionality out of the box.

To reduce tool clutter in your AI client, you can explicitly specify which domains to enable. **Only the domains you list will be enabled** - all others will be disabled.

**Enable only cards and boards:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "superthread": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-superthread-plus"],
      "env": {
        "SUPERTHREAD_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
        "SUPERTHREAD_ENABLED_TOOLS": "cards,boards"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Enable most tools except notes and tags:**
```json
{
  "env": {
    "SUPERTHREAD_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
    "SUPERTHREAD_ENABLED_TOOLS": "users,cards,boards,projects,spaces,sprints,pages,comments,search"
  }
}
```

**Important:**
- **Not set or empty** = All domains enabled (full functionality)
- **Set to specific domains** = Only those domains enabled, all others disabled
- This is backward compatible - existing configs without this setting will continue to work with all tools enabled

### Smart Card Positioning

By default, newly created or moved cards are added to the bottom of a list.
While this works well for most lists (like "Backlog" or "To Do"), it's
problematic for completion lists like "Done" or "Archived" where you typically
want to see the most recently completed items at the top. Without smart
positioning, recent completions get buried at the bottom, making it harder to
track what was just finished.

Configure lists where cards should automatically be positioned at the top using
`SUPERTHREAD_LISTS_ADD_TO_TOP`:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "SUPERTHREAD_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
    "SUPERTHREAD_LISTS_ADD_TO_TOP": "Done,Completed,Finished"
  }
}
```

**Features:**
- **Wildcard support:** Use `*` for pattern matching (e.g., `"Done,Complet*,*finished,*archive*"`)
- **Case-insensitive:** Matches "done", "Done", "DONE" equally
- **Comma escaping:** Use backslash for list names with commas (e.g., `"Tasks\\, Urgent"`)
- **LLM override:** Explicit position parameter in tools always takes precedence
- **Graceful fallback:** If board/sprint fetch fails, cards use default positioning

## Requirements

- **Node.js** 22+
- **Superthread account** with API access
- **Personal Access Token** from Superthread account settings

## Development

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/steveclarke/mcp-superthread-plus.git
cd mcp-superthread-plus
pnpm install
pnpm run build
```

### Commands

```bash
# Watch mode for development
pnpm run dev

# Build
pnpm run build

# Test
pnpm run test

# Lint
pnpm run lint
pnpm run lint:fix

# Format
pnpm run format
```

### Running Locally

Configure your MCP client to run from your local development directory:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "superthread": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/mcp-superthread-plus/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "SUPERTHREAD_API_KEY": "your-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Architecture

This server uses a composition-based API client architecture with resource classes for each domain (cards, boards, projects, etc.). The client handles authentication, error handling, and automatic terminology mapping between Superthread's modern UI terms and legacy API terms.

**For contributors:** See [`docs/contributing/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/contributing/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed architectural information and [`docs/contributing/API-REFERENCE.md`](docs/contributing/API-REFERENCE.md) for API terminology mapping.

**Important notes:** See [`docs/NOTES.md`](docs/NOTES.md) for information about API quirks, limitations, and undocumented endpoints.
